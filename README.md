# Business-Intelligence-Assignment #
This repository contains the code and analysis for my Business Intelligence assignment. The assignment focuses on analyzing an auto sales dataset to uncover insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

# Contents
Includes the assignment requirements. Contains Python scripts used for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine learning models.
Includes the dataset used for analysis before and after cleaning data. Provides visualizations and summaries of key findings from the analysis.

# Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled, inconsistencies were resolved, and data entry errors were corrected.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Univariate and bivariate statistics were conducted to understand the distribution of variables and explore relationships between them.
Machine Learning Models: Regression models were implemented to predict sales based on various features such as quantity ordered, price each, product line, and deal size.

# Key Insights
Sales tend to increase with higher product prices and larger quantities ordered.
Certain product lines contribute more to overall sales than others.
Recency of orders and deal size also impact sales performance.

# Usage
To replicate the analysis:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the Scripts or Notebooks directory to access the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
Open the scripts or notebooks using your preferred IDE or Jupyter environment.
Run the code cells to reproduce the analysis and generate visualizations.

# Dependencies
The analysis was conducted using Python 3.x and requires the following libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
